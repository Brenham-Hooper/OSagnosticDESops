# Installation steps.

This assignment seemed somewhat confusing to me, since the purpose seemed to be installing sagemath on your local machine, but the file for the third step also talks of setting up linux within windows for sagemath. I already have sagemath installed in Windows from the binaries, which seems to be a satisfactory way to complete this assignment? I'm not entirely sure due to the above uncertainty. I also already have WSL running on my machine for a previous course, so I should be in the clear even if this is mandatory.
